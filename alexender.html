 <font size ="5" face = "Comic Sans MS" color="black"> <i> <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The name of Alexander the Great (356-323 B.C.) still lives in the legends of the East, and traces of his swift conquest are still stamped upon the fabric of Western Asia. His name is famous as a conqueror and as the King of Macdonia. Alexander the Great was born in the Pella region of Macedonia on July 20, 356 B.C., to King Philip II of Macedon and Queen Olympia. This young, dark-eyed and curly-haired prince was tutored by the great philosopher, Aristotle. Alexander the Great conquered half the known world in thirteen years. This ruler swept aside the mighty armies of the Persian Empire and established his rule as far as Punjab. </p>

<p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Alexander the Great was far more than a general and a leader of armies. His colossal victories were followed by sympathetic, understanding administration and had won the loyalty of the defeated. Alexander, after conquering many kingdoms, was returning home. On the way, he fell ill. Knowing that his death was nearing, he longed to see his motherâ€™s face. However, he realized that his sinking health would not permit him to reach his mother as he was far from his homeland. Alexander the great realized that all his wealth and his conquests, his great army, his sharp sword would not help him to save his life. </p>

<p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp He called his generals and said, <b> <i> <font color="white">"I will depart from this world soon, I have threewishes, please carry them out without fail."</b> </i> </font> With tears flowing down their cheeks, the generals agreed to abide by their king's last wishes. </p>
